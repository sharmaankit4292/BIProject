Sure! Here's an updated version of the README that includes the reasoning for not considering ETIM:

# NexMart Data Quality Assessment

This project helps analyze and improve the quality of product data from NexMart. The goal is to clean up the product information, identify gaps, and make sure the data is ready for use across internal teams.

---

## What the Code Does

1. **Loads the data**  
   It reads three CSV files: `manufacturers.csv`, `product_descriptions.csv`, and `product_properties.csv`.

2. **Cleans up the data**  
   It replaces common bad values like "N/A", "null", or blank fields with `NaN` to standardize the data.

3. **Combines the data**  
   It merges the three files together using common columns (like `Article Number` and `Manufacturer number`) to create one full dataset.

4. **Checks data completeness**  
   It checks each product to see if all the required fields (like descriptions, EAN, etc.) are filled out. It flags whether a product is "complete" or missing information.

5. **Assesses data quality**  
   It labels each product as either "good" or "bad" quality. A product is considered "good" if it has:
   - A description
   - A valid EAN (barcode)
   - A product image

6. **Outputs the results**  
   - It saves the cleaned data with completeness checks.
   - It separates products into two files: **good quality** and **bad quality**.
   - It also loads the data into an in-memory database (SQLite) for easy querying.

## Why This Matters

### For Internal Teams:

- **Product & Content Teams**: They can focus on improving data where it’s most needed.
- **Marketing & E-commerce**: They can see which products have complete data for better listings.
- **Data & Tech Teams**: They can track data quality trends over time.

## Why EAN is Important

EAN (European Article Number) is essential because:
- It uniquely identifies each product.
- It’s required for proper syncing with other systems and platforms.
- Without an EAN, products won’t appear in search results or may not be recognized properly.

## Why ETIM Was Not Considered

ETIM (European Technical Information Model) is a standardized classification system used primarily for external systems (e.g., third-party platforms or suppliers). It’s essential for categorizing products in specific ways for external trade. 

However, ETIM wasn’t considered in this analysis because:
- **Internal Focus**: The goal was to assess and improve **internal data quality**, specifically product descriptions, EANs, and images, which directly affect how the products are displayed and managed in NexMart’s internal systems.
- **External Use**: ETIM is more relevant for product classification in external marketplaces or systems, not for assessing the quality of data that is used directly within NexMart’s internal processes.

Thus, focusing on fields like **description**, **EAN**, and **product image** provides more immediate value for NexMart’s internal teams, and these are the primary fields impacting product visibility, completeness, and quality.

## Files Generated

- `merged_data_with_completeness.csv`: Full dataset with completeness information.
- `good_quality_data.csv`: Products that have all the required fields (good quality).
- `bad_quality_data.csv`: Products missing key fields (bad quality).

---

## How to Use

1. Make sure the CSV file paths are correct.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Check the printed results and explore the exported CSV files or the SQLite database for more details.

This version now explains why ETIM was not included, keeping the reasoning simple and focused on internal data quality needs.
