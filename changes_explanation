Changes Explanation

1. Folder Structure Changes:
- Modified the folder structure to make it easier to emulate and clone in local Git repositories.
- The new structure is designed to be more intuitive and facilitate better version control practices.

2. File Updates:
- Replaced an existing file with updated versions.
- Added both .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) and .py files that now contain the desired results printed in Github.

3. Error Explanation:
- During the process of copying and pasting code from other Jupyter Notebooks, I accidentally pasted the print statement before the actual variable assignment.
- The sequence error occurred because:
  * The print statement was placed before the function call that generates the result
  * When Python executed the print statement, the variable being printed hadn't been defined yet
  * The function call that produces and stores the result was missing
- This has now been corrected by ensuring proper code sequence:
  1. First call the function and store its result
  2. Then print the result

The changes ensure the code executes properly and displays the expected output in both local environments and when rendered on GitHub.
